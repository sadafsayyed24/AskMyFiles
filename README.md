A FastAPI-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that lets you upload documents and chat with them using vector search and LLMs.

To run code: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload
Once code is running, use /upload api, only(csv/pdf), once done, use /chat api 
**

**Note: Everytime you run/save changes in code, you need to upload data first only then chat api will work
